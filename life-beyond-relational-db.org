   a peer-to-peer platform at Capital Match based on those

* A Simple Event Sourced Service from Scratch

 - A counter service:
   - Initial value is 0
   - Can =increment= counter with a positive value
   - Can =decrement= counter with a positive value
   - Can query state of the counter
   - Counter's value can not go below 0 or above 100

* What's been demoed

 - TDD w/ Property Based Testing
 - Purely functional model event sourced model
 - Services defined from composable effectful building blocks
 - Statically typed REST API w/ Servant (http://haskell-servant.github.io/)
 - Use the REPL, Luke!
