* Out of the Tar Pit

  - Famous article by Peter Marks and Ben Moseley from 2006
      (http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf) 
  - OO is not the right tool to fight back complexity within systems
  - Promotes an approach based on
  - *Functional Programming*
  - and *Relational Algebra*

* Out of the Tar Pit, really?

 - Business domains are rarely relational (or functional)
 - We want to speak the language of the business
 - Ubiquitous language
 - DDD 
 - Services, Entities, Commands, Events..

* Really getting out of the Tar Pit

 - *Divide quod impera*

     -> Side-effects free business domain model

 - Event Sourcing
     -> Stream of events = State of the system

* A Simple Event Sourced Service from Scratch

 - A counter service:
   - Starts at 0
   - Can =increment= counter with a positive value
   - Can =decrement= counter with a positive value
   - Can query state of the counter

* What's demoed

 - Statically typed REST API w/ Servant (http://haskell-servant.github.io/)
 - Purely functional model event sourced model
 - Simple file-based storage
 - Use the REPL, Luke!
 - Property Based Testing
